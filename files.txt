Most of the source files are in src/*.cpp with corresponding header files src/*.h

The source files in src/*.cpp do not define main(). This is defined for the optimizer program in main.cpp and for unit tests in test.cpp

For now, while the project is small, simplicity and ease of maintenance are more important than compile speed. Thus, every source file includes every header file.
