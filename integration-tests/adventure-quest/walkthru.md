At this point, the game should recognize that you have both required items in the Ruined Temple and trigger the victory condition. You'll see a message about the items glowing and a hidden passage appearing, followed by the victory screen.

## Optional Commands

Throughout your adventure, you can use these commands as needed:

- `inventory` - Check your status, equipment, and inventory
- `use berry` or `use bread` - Heal yourself if your health gets low
- `examine [item]` - Get more information about an item
- `help` - Display all available commands

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with the Ancient Guardian:
- Make sure you have the best equipment (Steel Sword and Plate Armor)
- Use healing items before and during the battle
- Ensure your health is full before starting the fight

If the victory condition doesn't trigger:
- Verify you have both the Ancient Amulet and Guardian Crystal in your inventory
- Make sure you've defeated the Ancient Guardian
- Try leaving the Ruined Temple and returning

Good luck on your adventure!
